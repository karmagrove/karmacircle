    <h2> The Story of Karma Grove </h2>
    <p>Karma Grove came about as a dream of a college student in 2005 studying international business and finance.  Joshua Montross was a bit disappointed with the constant pushing of rational self interest meaning to maximize profits.  He wanted to create a cafe called Karma Grove Cafe and make it exist to both create some profits and to help the community.  
    Karma Grove LLC was formed in 2013 as a little granola bar company where Joshua would take the granola bars to Santa Cruz Farmers market, and spread his dreams and ideas amongst friends and family in both Dallas, Texas and Santa Cruz, California.  Later, he would sell them at Dallas Ecstatic Dance.  Sell is a very loose word as these were given away with the option of giving back, and if you gave to Joshua, he would give half of your money to charity of your choice.  The first charities supported were Grey Bears of Santa Cruz, Elephants and Bees of Africa, and Genesis Women's shelter of Dallas.  Joshua would raise money for them with his bake sales, testing out the idea that people would give more when they knew they were also supporting charity.</p>

    <h4 class="text-center">The idea seemed to work.  Now it is usable by all.</h4>
    <p>
      This website and system of Karma Grove is his dream mixed with effort to create a reality where more businesses are able to give to charity as they receive.  One day we will open the cafe.  Until then, we make the software possible for others to easily operate their businesses with greater community consciousness, which we believe may actually increase your sales in the end.
